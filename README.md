# 💬 Internet Chatting Application in Python

**Course:** CNT 5106 - Computer Networks  
**Project 3:** Internet Chatting – Socket-based Communication  
**Language:** Python

---

## 📌 Description

This project implements a terminal-based chat application using **Python socket programming**. It allows two users to send and receive real-time messages over a TCP connection. The application demonstrates bidirectional communication, socket creation, and concurrent input/output handling using multithreading.
